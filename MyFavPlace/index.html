    <h1>Shibuya, Japan</h1>
    <p> Shibuya, Japan is located in Tokyo, one of the most famous cities in the world. Shibuya is known for their major fashion and shopping centers. It is also a very popular tourist site for those who are not from the country. I like to visit Shibuya with one of my best friends every summer when I get to see her. We enjoy a full day of shopping, eating, taking the train, and walking. Another popular site within Shibuya is the Shibuya crossing. It is an intersection in the heart of the city, where a vast amount of people cross everyday.
